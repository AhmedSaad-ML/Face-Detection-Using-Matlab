# Face-Detection-Using-Matlab
This Project was done using Matlab it is about detecting if a picture contain a face or not using Viola Jones Filter and KNN Algorithm.

First you have to change images form rgb to grayscale (if it is not already in grayscale) in order to use the viola jones filter.

# Viola jones Filter:

I applied 3 different filters A, C and D

To compare the performace of those 3 Filters i used KNN Alogrithm

# KNN Algorithm:

It works by by determining the Distance between the point (Pic) we want to classify and the N number of nearest points.
